[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nitrux/znx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nitrux/znx)

- Parallel deployments of Linux distributions.
- Upgrade the systems in an atomic way.
- Update the images with differential content (just the missing or modified blocks are downloaded).

For more information about how `znx` works, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/Nitrux/znx/wiki).

In the image below, you can see `znx`'s boot menu.

Examples:

  Initialize a device:
  - znx init /dev/sdX

  Restore the ESP of a device:
  - znx restore /dev/sdX

  Deploy an image:
  - znx deploy /dev/sdX vendor/release http://foo.bar/image.iso
  - znx deploy /dev/sdX vendor/release /path/to/image.iso

  Update an image:
  - znx update /dev/sdX vendor/release

  Revert an update (downgrade):
  - znx revert /dev/sdX vendor/release

  Delete the backup of an image:
  - znx clean /dev/sdX vendor/release

  Reset an image to its original state:
  - znx reset /dev/sdX vendor/release

  Remove an image:
  - znx remove /dev/sdX vendor/release

  Show statistics about an image:
  - znx stats /dev/sdX vendor/release

  - znx list /dev/sdX
```

Be sure to replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your device, use the commands `lsblk`, `fdisk` or `blkid` to find the correct device.

**NOTE:**
_If you are not so into typing commands in a terminal, you can check [znx-gui](https://github.com/Nitrux/znx-gui), which is a Qt-based graphical frontend for `znx`, and is provided as an AppImage._
